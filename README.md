# JAX-FVM
JAX-FVM is a differentiable finite volume method for unstructured meshes based on [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax). 

The equations are the 2D Euler equations, the 2D compressible NS equations. A script is also given as a 2D Fourier-Galerkin solver for the incompressible NS equations. 

## Documentation
Small examples are given in the examples folder. 


## Key features
JAX-FVM is Automatic Differentiation (AD) + Finite Volume Method (FVM)
- Unstructured meshes with 2D triangle elements
- First and second order methods for both Euler and compressible NS equations
- (in process), read and write vtk files
